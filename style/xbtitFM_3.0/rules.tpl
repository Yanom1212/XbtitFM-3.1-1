<b>.::Torrent Uploading Rules::. - torrents violating these rules may be deleted::.</b>
<table width=100% border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>
By Uploading to <tag:site_name /> you agree to follow our guidelines and our rules, failure to do so will result in your Upload being deleted without prior notice, and in repeated cases, UL capabilities can be taken away and warnings can be issued.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Only power users and above have the ability to upload.<br />
<br />
ALL <span style="color:orange">Orange<!--color--></span> text below are clickable links that takes you to more in depth explanations. Please note some guides are animated and have been tested with firefox browser with java script turned off. <br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Basic Uploading Rules<!--u--></span><br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * All uploads must have the correct <a href=smf/index.php?topic=5.0 target="_blank">RAR</a> sizes.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * All uploads must include a proper</strong> <a href=smf/index.php?topic=2.0 target="_blank">NFO</a> file.<br />
 <br />
 &nbsp; * All uploads must include an <a href=smf/index.php?topic=3.0 target="_blank">SFV</a> file.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Improperly prepared torrents will be deleted!!<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * All uploads which are not music <a href=smf/index.php?topic=4.0 target="_blank">.MP3/WMA/FLAC/AAC/APE/WAV</a> or a <span style="color:red">0-Day Pack<!--color--></span> must be RAR'd<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * ZIP files are NOT allowed, please repack into RAR files, ZIPPED files WILL be deleted. <span style="color:red">EXCEPT 0-Day Packs.<!--color--></span> and <span style="color:red"> MUSIC<!--color--></span> Which are the ONLY exception to this Rule.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Make sure <span style="color:red">NOT<!--color--></span> to include any mention of serial numbers, CD keys, Cracks, Keygens or similar in the description, title or the .torrent itself (you do not need to edit the NFO!).<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Determine ahead of time whether you have the time, bandwidth and opportunity to seed your torrent until it has at least 4 active seeders other than yourself and/or has been snatched 8 times. <br />
 <br />
 &nbsp; * Make sure your torrents are well-seeded for at least 48 hours. (rather 72 hours)<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Check that the torrent has not already been uploaded to the site (use the search function). Duplicate torrents will be deleted!<br />
 &nbsp;Note: a duplicate is when it is the EXACT same file/release - a different quality encode is not a duplicate.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * For content like games or movies that consist of multiple disks, repeat this process for each disk individually, leave each disk in a separate folder, labeled e.g. Disk 1, Disk 2 or CD 1, CD 2 etc. collect all disks/CD folders in one main folder, which you will use to make the torrent itself later on.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Scene releases of movies, games, etc should not be repacked, and should be left with their original RAR sizes (as long as they are compressed into split archives in the first place).<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * To avoid duplicates and general confusion, scene releases should have their release name in the title and their nfo's intact, and with the release group's name still included.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Do not include the release date in the torrent name.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Do not password protect the archives! <br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Do not upload any child pornography<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Adding a link to a picture is optional, but recommended if you have one (screen shot) It will display up to a width of 500 px (larger images will be automatically resized). <br />
 &nbsp;NOTE: NO nudity/naked images in the torrent descriptions,forums or torrent comments please. They will be removed and a warning will be given if you continue to ignore this rule.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Apart from the normal description, a link to a site with additional information and/or screen shots is recommended if available.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Do not add your name to a torrent if you did not rip/create the files yourself!<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Try not to seed too many torrents at a time.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Try not to seed files bigger than your connection is capable of in a reasonable amount of time, i.e. uploading a DVD at 10kbps might not make everyone as happy.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Any form of linking to another site through the name of the torrent file or any files contained within the torrent is forbidden. see <a href=smf/index.php?topic=7.0 target="_blank">Advertising</a> for more details.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * If you are having internet trouble which may interfere with your seeding, let the leechers know a small torrent comment post can save alot of confusion<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * A detailed torrent description is a MUST 1 or 2 lines is NOT a detailed description <br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Anyone uploading a torrent HAS to be <a href=smf/index.php?topic=8.0 target="_blank">Connectable.</a><br />
<br />
 &nbsp; * Do not upload any material that contains actual or implied to be actual (no matter how fictional the content): killings, executions, suicides, accidents, mutilation or torture (of both humans and animals) that has no journalistic, educational or other justifying context for the material being present. Some Examples:<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp;* The following are not allowed to be uploaded on this site due to the above rule: Faces Of Death; Faces Of Gore; Terrorists, Killers, &amp; Middle East Wackos; etc<br />
<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp;* The following are allowed to be uploaded on this site due to the material being presented in a justifiable context: BBC/C4/CBC/etc documentaries on war/torture/etc.<br />
<br />
This rule and how it is applied is not up to debate. If you are in doubt as to what is acceptable, pm a moderator before you upload..<br />

<b>.::Hit and Runs::.</b>
<table width=100% border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>
A hit and Run is when you snatch a torrent less than 72 hours old and do not seed back the minimum ratio.<br />
<br />
All torrents 72 hours or less old must be seeded to a minimum of 1:1,or you must seed a minimum of 48 hours whichever comes first. There are no exceptions. This Rule is for everybody.
