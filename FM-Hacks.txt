In the process of converting these hacks to the framework used in xbtitFM pretty much every hack has been modified/improved from the original xbtit version by myself, however this has not been a solo project.

Without the help of the entire Developer Team this project could have never happened, a special shout goes out to DiemThuy for all the bugs she has found whilst testing xbtitFM, hopefully she didn't miss too many. :D
